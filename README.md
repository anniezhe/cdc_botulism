# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Botulism Report from 1899 to 2017
This repository contains all of my materials to build a botulism report using the [CDC's public dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/Foodborne-Waterborne-and-Related-Diseases/Botulism/66i6-hisz/about_data). 

### What will you need to view my report?
You'll need a PowerBI software installed on your computer. Go to [Microsoft's PowerBI product website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) to get started.

### How did you view the CDC's botulism dataset on your PowerBI software?
I use their API link to see their data on my software. Below are the steps to use the API link on the software:


1) On the CDC website, click on "Actions" button.

2) Select "API" option. You should see the pop-up message below. Copy the link shown in the red area.

<b>Why are we just copying the link?</b> The API link can actually pull the entire dataset <b>without</b> modifying anything to the link. If you modify it, the API link will have trouble pulling data.

3) Open up the PowerBI software, and select the "Get data from other sources" option.

### A note about my report
There are some entries where the CDC isn't able to identify the state. I decide not to delete any of these entries, because the purpose of my report is to give a full view of what the CDC's botulism dataset contains. Depending on what is <b>your purpose</b>, deleting entries with missing values may be the best option <b>for you</b>. <b>Please be careful when making the decision to delete entries</b>.
