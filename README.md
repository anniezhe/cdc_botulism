# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Botulism Report from 1899 to 2017
This repository contains all of my materials to build a botulism report using the CDC's public dataset [here](https://data.cdc.gov/Foodborne-Waterborne-and-Related-Diseases/Botulism/66i6-hisz/about_data). 

### What will you need to view my report?
You'll need a PowerBI software installed on your computer. Go to [Microsoft's PowerBI product website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi) to get started.

### How did you view the CDC's botulism dataset on your PowerBI software?
I download the entire data from their website in csv file.

### A note about my report
There are some entries where the CDC isn't able to identify the state. I decide not to delete any of these entries, because the purpose of my report is to give a full view of what the CDC's botulism dataset contains. Depending on what is <b>your purpose</b>, deleting entries with missing values may be the best option <b>for you</b>. <b>Please be careful when making the decision to delete entries</b>.
